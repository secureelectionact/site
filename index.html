							  <p>Dear U.S. Citizens,&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Due to election fraud by State and Local Government, I have written this Amendment. This Amendment is to Article 1-Section 4 of our U.S. Constitution. I have read our Constitution twice to e4nsure that anything in this Amendment does not interfere with anything other than Article 1 Section 4. I have spent 5 months carefully writing the Amendment. </p>
<p>This Amendment is going to be up to We the People to ensure that we have fair and honest elections to avoid fake installed politicians running our country. &nbsp;<br>
	    </p>
<p>It is time for We the People to let our government know that they work for us! We do not work for them!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please <a href="amendment.html">Read the Amendment</a> and share it nationwide with everyone. We must have this passed in order keep our country!</p></section>
